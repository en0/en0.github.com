            <h1>Let's Get Rolling.</h1>
<p>I have been toying with the idea of posting my thoughts and
discoveries for many years now. I have never really had the time or the guts to
do it.  Until recently, I have been content just doing what I do and sharing
my skills with my friends and coworkers.</p>
<p>Lately, I have found myself wishing i had written things down. There are so
many fine details in any technical job it begins to get difficult to keep
everything organized and clear in your mind. </p>
<p>This has driven me to start this blog.  I do not have any content yet. I will
not promise any content soon.  This blog is mostly for myself: to catalog my
thoughts and share ideas with people that ask.</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Well, let us keep it superficial for now. I am a software engineer. I write
code because I enjoy and people pay me to.  It's a pretty good situation and I
feel very lucky to do something I enjoy to provide for my family. I spend time
as far away from the user interface as possible, unless my user lives in bash.
I am of the firm opinion that your really only need 2 program languages to solve
most real world software problems, C and Python.</p>
<p>That is all for now.</p>
