Summary: My answer to the question: "What do you think of the current state of programming in high school?"

# <small>Context</small>

About a year ago, I was asked to describe my opinion of the current state
of programming in schools. My response was somewhat long winded. Certainly
longer then the inquisitor expected.

As I feel very strongly about this topic, I was compelled to share as complete
an answer as I could achieve at that moment.  I would like to share the answer
with anyone that might stumble onto my page in hope that it might effect
change. Or at least challenge students to dig deeper and go beyond what they
where taught in school.

# <small>Answer</small>

Professor Loren Graham tells us that knowing the name of something or of
someone gives you power over that thing or person.<sup>[1]</sup>

Programming is the name of an action, a profession, a skill. The name helps to
create understanding of that action, profession and skill.  As a programmer, I
know what programming is and what it means. Before we continue, I want to make
sure we can agree on the context of this word.

## <small>Definition</small>

> "creating a sequence of instructions to enable the computer to do something"

> -- As defined on [The free dictionary](www.thefreedictionary.com/computer+programming)


## <small>Why</small>

> "The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
> automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem."

> -- As outlined on [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)

## <small>How</small>

In my experience, computer programming leads from the process of an original
formulation of a computing problem. Programming involves activities such as
analysis, understanding of domain specific concepts, generating algorithms,
verification of requirements and correctness of those algorithms, and writing
source code.<sup>[2]</sup> Writing code is often the smallest part of all the
activities involved in _programming_.

I hope we can agree on these definitions and I will concede that the use of
Wiki is not adequate for a true academic discussion around this topic but it
will have to suffice for now.

## <small>Juxtaposition in Academic Learning</small>

In Mathematics, the approach is to start with the fundamentals. Even from the
earliest ages we are taught how to count. We are taught the ideas of
numbers: The concept that 7 is much more then a symbol. This is a simple and
powerful concept and the foundation for everything in mathematics.

These ideas are built on to give a basic understanding of arithmetic. The
concept of arithmetic is used as the foundation for algebra. Algebra becomes
the next foundation for geometry and this process continue to trigonometry and
calculus and all the way up to very advanced mathematics.

Unlike mathematics, programming classes do not follow this approach. Event
though writing code is such a small part of computer programming, the
fundamentals are often glossed over, giving priority to writing simple _vending
machine style_ applications that have very little to do with the underlining
science. This creates copy and paste programmers that google all their
situations to find a canned solution because, to them, this is _programming_.

Fundamental concepts such as hardware signaling, processor architecture, state
machines, Boolean logic, Boolean math, and binary math are often missing from
these classes but should be the focus of a computer science coreiculum.
Exploring some code is beneficial. But, the goal is not to program. It is to lay
the foundation for the next concepts of requirements gathering, algorithm
design, data structures, and more.

## <small>To answer the question</small>

With that analysis out of the way, I will now answer the question: Can you
describe to me what you think about the current state of programming in
schools?

Programming is schools is falling short. It is being taught as a trade skill,
though it is a science. It is producing _"programmers"_ that have very little
understanding of how computers function and what will be expected of them in
the real world.

# <small>Thoughts</small>

I would also like to offer a better question:
> Do you feel that teaching computer programming at a __high school__ level is
> even a good idea?

I feel that teaching some computer science is beneficial. But not everyone is
going to be a programmer. Knowing what it is and its basic foundations make
sense.  Certainly computers are not going away. But, they are changing faster
then it takes to obtain a 4 year degree.  Teaching kids how to _program_ as a
requirement is just silly. Teaching programming without a foundation is
just a waist of everyones time.
